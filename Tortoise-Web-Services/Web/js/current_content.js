Why TORTOISE? Our software is not for rabbit type people; if you need to process diffusion data at the scanner console you do not want to use our software.

Why obsessive? We have realized that DTI is a wonderful quantitative technique which is unfortunately susceptible to all sorts of artifacts and confounds. We spent a lot of time trying to obtain reliable DTI measurements, which has made ourselves and our software a little obsessive. Why indolent? Our emphasis has been on developing conceptually rigorous routines more than optimizing the speed and user-friendliness of the software.

TORTOISE was presented at the ISMRM meeting in Stockholm, Sweden in 2010. Please reference the following abstract if you use TORTOISE in your work.

C. Pierpaoli, L. Walker, M. O. Irfanoglu, A. Barnett, P. Basser, L-C. Chang, C. Koay, S. Pajevic, G. Rohde, J. Sarlls, and M. Wu, 2010, TORTOISE: an integrated software package for processing of diffusion MRI data, ISMRM 18th annual meeting, Stockholm, Sweden, #1597 (pdf)

The TORTOISE software package is for processing diffusion MRI data, and it contains three main modules:

    DIFF_PREP - software for image resampling, motion, eddy current distortion, and EPI distortion correction using a structural image as target, and for re-orientation of data to a common space
    DIFF_CALC - software for tensor fitting, error analysis, directionally encoded color map visualization and ROI analysis
    DR-BUDDI- software for EPI distortion correction using pairs of diffusion data sets acquired with opposite phase encoding (blip-up blip-down acquisitions). 

In addition, TORTOISE contains additional Utilities, such as a tool for the analysis of multi-center phantom data.

Some common questions and answers about our software packages are listed in the FAQ.

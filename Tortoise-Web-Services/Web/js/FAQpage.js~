                        What does this mean?',
            answer   : 'This occurs when the automatic noise computation algorithm encounters an image (usually the structural target image) which has a zero background value, or an unexpected range of values. \
                        There are 3 possible solutions to this problem:\
                        <ul>\
                            <li>\
                                If this is done on purpose, such as you decide to use a masked structural target (not recommended!), you will need to enter a reasonable noise value using the optional \
                                settings in DIFF_PREP for the background noise padding that is performed in the code.\
                            </li>\

                                If you have manipulated your structural target image (such as ACPC re-orientation and skull attenuation) and this has resulted in zero values in the background, you will \
